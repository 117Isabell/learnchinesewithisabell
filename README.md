## Improvements

If I had more time, I would enhance the project by building the backend using Node.js, EJS, and MongoDB. This would allow for:

Dynamic Content: Using EJS to render dynamic web pages.
Database Integration: Implementing MongoDB to store user data, course information, and other resources.
User Authentication: Adding login and registration functionalities.
Enhanced Interactivity: Creating a more interactive user experience with personalized content.
